# Welcome to my page!

## Current work
I am a PhD student working at LATTICE and Sciences Po Medialab. I'm working on natural language processing and its applications to social sciences. Before that, I was a student at ENSAE, interested in machine and deep learning. 

Some of my first projects so far are documented here : 

 - [embeddings](https://sally14.github.io/embeddings/index.html) is a small project aiming at giving a simple wrapper to preprocess text and generate word2vec embeddings in an easy way. The preprocessing part is written by me and totally multiprocessed, so that large corpus can be treated efficiently. The word2vec model learning part is a simple cli wrapper based on [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). 
 
 
 Further projects on embeddings and contextual embeddings across social spaces are in progress.
 

 
 ## Teaching
 Apart from that, I work as a teaching assistant for Xavier Dupr√©'s [Python for data scientist course at ENSAE](http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/ensae_teaching_cs/helpsphinx/td_2a.html). I wrote some introductory material for my students, that you can find (here)[https://github.com/sally14/ensae-python-2019]. (french)
 

 ## Previous work
 On previous projects, I created biomedical named entity recognition systems for a startup called Posos, and wrote a (langage model script with Tensorflow)[https://github.com/sally14/language-model-ENSAE] for a NLP course at ENSAE
