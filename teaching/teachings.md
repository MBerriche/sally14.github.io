## Python pour le Data Scientist 

I currently work as a teaching assistant at ENSAE IP Paris for Xavier Dupr√©'s [Python pour le Data Scientist](http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/ensae_teaching_cs/helpsphinx/td_2a.html).

This course is an introductory course to machine learning and includes a lot of lab sessions with python and scikit-learn.

The outline of the lab sessions is the following : 

- [x] **TP1** : *ML basics, classification, classification metrics*. [Notebook](./notebooks/TP1_classification.html)
- [x] **TP2** : *Regression, regression metrics, trees, random forests*. [Notebook](./notebooks/TP2_random_forest.html)
- [x] **TP3** : *Cross validation, boosting, hyperparameter tuning* [Notebook](./notebooks/TP3_boosting.html)
- [ ] **TP4** : *Deep learning basics and introduction to natural language processing with Keras.* [Notebook](./notebooks/TP4_dl_nlp.html)

The complete github repository containing the ```.ipynb``` files can be found [here](https://github.com/sally14/ensae-python-2019). 


I am currently writing an introduction to good coding practice for data scientist beginners, i.e. : git, pep8, virtual environments, code documentation.
The work is in progress and can be found here:
